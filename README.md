# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite Landing Page Template

A basic landing page using Vue 3 with TypeScript in a Vite environment. It integrates Tailwind CSS for styling purposes. Refer to the [script setup documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) for detailed information.

## Recommended Setup

To enhance your development experience, we recommend using:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) extension (formerly Volar). It provides excellent support for Vue 3 development. We suggest disabling Vetur to avoid conflicts.
- Utilize [vue-tsc](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/tsc) for running type checks via the command line or generating d.ts files for Single File Components (SFCs).
